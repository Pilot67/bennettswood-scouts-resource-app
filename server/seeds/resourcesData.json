    "description": "A frame tent has a roof-like structure built with tent poles that work to keep the tent up.\nThere are no poles in the tent’s center, which frees up space inside the tent, allowing you to create a layout that suits your needs.\n\nThese tents range in size but generally feature 8ft tall perimeter poles, but they can be seen up to 20ft poles used! They can be quite large, making them perfect for larger outdoor parties. Frame tents are the preferred tent for long-term installations or windier climates as they are incredibly sturdy. They can be used on grass or asphalt surfaces with stakes drilled into the ground to ensure their stability. They can also be used on concrete too, with lugs sunk into the concrete or water barrels, but these can be costly installations and only worth doing if the tent will be erected on a long-term basis. The sturdy structure and stability make the tent the perfect choice for events such as parties and weddings!  Now that we have covered what a frame tent is let’s answer some of your burning questions!",
