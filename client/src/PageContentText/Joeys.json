  "description": "Joey Scouts commence at 5 years of age and transition to the Cub Scout Unit after turning 8 and before turning 9.\n\nJoey Scouts are:\nDiscovering the world around them\nDeveloping friendships\nExperiencing greater interactive experiences\nPhysically active\nUsing broad imagination and play\nThis is the first Section of the Scouting journey.\n\nJoey Scouts meet each week as a Joey Scout Unit, and wear their Sectionâ€™s uniform shirt, the scarf of the local Scout Group they belong to, and a woggle to hold their scarf together.\nFor our youngest members, the Joey Scout program nurtures a deeper understanding of the world around them, with a growing awareness of their surroundings and nature, by getting out and about in the community.\nLike all Scouts, Joey Scouts participate in the Achievement Pathway award scheme and are presented with badges to recognise their achievement. \nA Joey Scout can even decide if they would like to achieve their Sections peak award, the Joey Scout Challenge Award, the highest achievement in the Joey Scout Section.\nEvery two years, Joey Scouts have the opportunity to attend a Kangaree, a massive overnight sleepover with activities and entertainment with hundreds of Joey Scouts from all over the State."
