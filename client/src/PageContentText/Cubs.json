  "description": "Cub Scouts is for young people starting from 8 years of age who transition to the Scout Unit after turning 11 and before turning 12.\n\nCub Scouts are:\nCreating their own paths\nDeveloping their sense of place\nExploring the world around them\nEncountering new experiences\nExpanding perspectives\nDetermining their own adventures\nBuilding upon friendships\n\nThey meet once a week as well as going on some super cool weekend activities.\nThere are fun camps for Cub Scouts which could have interesting themes like ‘Space Odyssey’ or ‘Pirates on the High Seas’. With some experience, you can even join a 5-day ‘Cuboree’ with hundreds of other excited Cub Scouts at Gilwell Park, near Gembrook.\nCub Scouts play fantastic games like scavenger hunts or they might build a catapult together.\nThey can also earn a range of badges for bushcraft, cooking, canoeing and many other skills.  There’s even a ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ badge, designed with the help of Victoria Police, which involves the Cub Scouts being aware of emergency phone numbers and learning about security issues for themselves or their homes."
