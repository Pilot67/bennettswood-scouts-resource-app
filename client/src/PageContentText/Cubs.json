With some experience, you can even join a 5-day ‘Cuboree’ with hundreds of other excited Cub Scouts at Gilwell Park, near Gembrook.\nCub Scouts play fantastic games like scavenger hunts or they might build a catapult together.\nThey can also earn a range of badges for bushcraft, cooking, canoeing and many other skills.  There’s even a ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ badge, designed with the help of Victoria Police, which involves the Cub Scouts being aware of emergency phone numbers and learning about security issues for themselves or their homes."
